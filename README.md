# FriendsListProject
This project allows you to first add the names of your friends in a list and then makes it possible to see that list. I have used MongoDB Atlas as the cloud database for storing the list of friends. And we retrieve the list from the same database as well.The technologies used in this project are MongoDB,Nodejs,Express server,Fetch API and basic HTML.
